Workout: Prioritize compound lifts (bench press, squats, deadlifts) with 3–5 sets of 8–12 reps. Train 5 days a week with a push-pull-legs split. Include HIIT cardio sessions twice a week for endurance.
Diet: Aim for 1.6–2.2g of protein per kg of body weight. Incorporate complex carbs (sweet potatoes, oats) for sustained energy and healthy fats (avocados, nuts) for recovery. Consider adding a whey protein shake post-workout.
Lifestyle: Stay hydrated with at least 3 liters of water daily. Avoid alcohol and focus on stretching or yoga to improve flexibility and prevent injuries.
